### **Hack 8: Signal Jamming**

## **Introduction**
Signal jamming involves disrupting communication between devices by transmitting interference signals. This concept is useful for:
- **Testing device resilience** to interference.
- **Understanding signal vulnerabilities** in wireless communication systems.

The Flipper Zero can be configured to create controlled interference within specific wireless frequencies, like Sub-GHz, to simulate jamming effects for educational or testing purposes.

> **Note**: Unauthorized signal jamming is illegal in many jurisdictions. Ensure you use this functionality only in private, controlled environments where you have explicit permission.

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **1. Access the Sub-GHz Application**
- Turn on the Flipper Zero.
- Navigate to **Applications > Sub-GHz**.

---

### **2. Identify the Target Frequency**
- Use the **Frequency Analyzer** to detect active wireless frequencies nearby.
- Look for devices operating in common Sub-GHz ranges, such as:
  - **433 MHz**: Common for garage doors and RF remotes.
  - **868 MHz**: Used in some IoT systems.
- Make a note of the detected frequency.

**Example Output**:
```
Frequency: 433.92 MHz
Signal Strength: -45 dBm
```

---

### **3. Set Up the Interference Signal**
- From the Sub-GHz menu, select **Custom Transmission**.
- Enter the frequency you wish to test (e.g., 433.92 MHz).
- Configure the signal parameters:
  - **Modulation**: Choose AM (Amplitude Modulation) or FM (Frequency Modulation).
  - **Power Level**: Set to the minimum effective range to ensure limited interference.

---

### **4. Transmit the Signal**
- Select **Start Transmission**.
- The Flipper Zero will begin transmitting the configured signal at the specified frequency.
- Observe how the target device behaves under interference.

---

### **5. Analyze Results**
- Test the device’s response to the interference. For example:
  - A remote-controlled car might stop responding to commands.
  - A garage door opener might fail to activate.
- Document your findings to understand the effects of signal disruption.

---

## **Practical Applications**
- **Device Testing**: Assess the resilience of wireless devices to interference.
- **Security Research**: Explore vulnerabilities in Sub-GHz communication protocols.
- **Educational Use**: Learn about wireless signal behavior and mitigation techniques.

---

## **Tips and Warnings**
- **Ethical Use Only**: Perform jamming tests only in environments where you have explicit permission and control.
- **Minimize Range**: Use the lowest power setting to avoid unintended interference.
- **Legal Considerations**: Be aware of local regulations regarding wireless transmissions.
