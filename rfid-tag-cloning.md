# RFID Tag Cloning Draft Content
## Introduction

What is RFID?
Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) uses electromagnetic fields to identify and communicate with tags. RFID is common in:

Key fobs and access cards.
Asset tracking in warehouses.
Public transportation cards.
Why is it Useful?
With the Flipper Zero, you can:

Read RFID tags to analyze their properties.
Clone RFID tags onto writable tags for testing.
Emulate RFID tags for troubleshooting.
Ethical Note: Ensure you have permission to read or clone RFID tags, as unauthorized use is illegal.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Access the RFID Application
Power on the Flipper Zero and navigate to the RFID Application.
Select Read RFID to prepare for scanning.

### Step 2: Scan the RFID Tag
Hold the RFID tag close to the back of the Flipper Zero.
The device will display tag details, including:
Tag type (e.g., ISO 14443A).
Tag ID and memory size.

Example Output:
'''
Tag ID: 00123456789A
Type: ISO 14443A
Memory: 1 KB
Step 3: Save the Tag Data
'''

Once the tag is scanned, choose Save from the menu.
Name the tag for future reference (e.g., “Office Key”).

Step 4: Clone the RFID Tag
Insert a writable RFID tag into the writable field on the Flipper Zero.
Navigate to the Write RFID option and select the saved tag.
Confirm the operation to write the data to the blank tag.

Step 5: Emulate the RFID Tag
Navigate to Saved Tags in the RFID application.
Select the tag to emulate and press Emulate.
Test by holding the Flipper Zero near an RFID reader.
Practical Applications

### Backup Tags: Create a backup of your RFID tags for convenience.
Testing Security: Evaluate the security of RFID-based systems.
Educational Use: Learn how RFID technology operates and how to safeguard it.
Tips and Warnings

### Tag Compatibility: Some RFID tags are encrypted or proprietary and may not be clonable.

### Ethical Use: Only clone RFID tags you own or have explicit permission to test.

### Storage Management: Organize saved tags for quick access.
