### **Hack 6: GPIO Signal Testing**

## **Introduction**
The General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) feature of the Flipper Zero allows you to interact with hardware devices such as LEDs, sensors, and microcontrollers. This makes it a versatile tool for:
- **Testing hardware connections.**
- **Learning electronics basics.**
- **Programming custom projects.**

> **Note**: Always double-check connections to avoid damaging your hardware or the Flipper Zero.

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **1. Access the GPIO Application**
- Turn on the Flipper Zero.
- Navigate to **Applications > GPIO**.

---

### **2. Connect Hardware to GPIO Pins**
- Use jumper wires to connect the Flipper Zero GPIO pins to your hardware.  
  - For example:
    - **Pin 1**: Power (3.3V or 5V).
    - **Pin 2**: Ground (GND).
    - **Pin 3**: Signal (e.g., connected to an LED or sensor).
- Refer to the Flipper Zero’s GPIO pinout diagram for proper connections.

---

### **3. Configure GPIO Settings**
- Open the GPIO menu on the Flipper Zero.
- Select the pin you’ve connected (e.g., Pin 3).
- Choose whether to set the pin as **Input** or **Output**:
  - **Input**: Reads signals from a sensor or button.
  - **Output**: Sends signals to control devices like LEDs.

---

### **4. Test the Connection**
- If using **Output**:
  - Set the pin state to **High** or **Low** to control the device (e.g., turning an LED on or off).
- If using **Input**:
  - Monitor the pin state to detect changes (e.g., a button press).

---

### **5. Save GPIO Configurations**
- Save your pin settings for easy access in future sessions.
- Use descriptive names (e.g., “LED Control” or “Sensor Input”).

---

## **Practical Applications**
- **Hardware Prototyping**: Test circuits before implementing them in larger projects.
- **Learn Electronics**: Experiment with basic components like LEDs, resistors, and sensors.
- **Custom Tools**: Program the Flipper Zero for unique tasks like automation or data logging.

---

## **Tips and Warnings**
- **Double-Check Connections**: Ensure correct polarity and voltage to avoid damage.
- **Use Resistors**: When working with LEDs or sensitive components, use appropriate resistors.
- **Backup Configurations**: Save your GPIO settings to avoid reconfiguration during each use.
