Got it! Let’s reformat Hack 1 to match the style of your README. Once that’s complete, we’ll move to Hack 2.

### **Hack 1: NFC Tag Reading and Cloning**

## **Introduction**
Near-Field Communication (NFC) is a wireless protocol allowing devices to exchange data over short distances. It’s commonly used for:
- Access control (e.g., office badges, hotel room keys).
- Contactless payments.
- Smart home devices.

With the Flipper Zero, you can:
- **Read and save** NFC tags for backup or analysis.
- **Clone** tags onto writable NFC cards.
- **Emulate** NFC tags for testing.

> **Note**: Ensure you have permission to read or clone NFC tags to stay ethical and legal.

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **1. Power Up Your Flipper Zero**
- Turn on your device and navigate to **Applications > NFC**.
- Select **Read NFC**.

---

### **2. Scan the NFC Tag**
- Hold the NFC tag close to the Flipper Zero's sensor.
- Wait for the device to display the tag’s details, such as:
  - **Tag ID**
  - **Type** (e.g., MIFARE Classic)
  - **Size**

**Example Output**:
```
Tag ID: 04:A3:22:1B:58:8F:4C
Type: MIFARE Classic
Size: 1 KB
```

---

### **3. Save the Tag Data**
- Once scanned, select **Save**.
- Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Office Badge") for easy reference.

---

### **4. Clone the NFC Tag**
- Insert a writable NFC card into the Flipper Zero.
- Choose **Write** from the NFC menu and select the saved tag.
- Confirm to clone the data onto the blank tag.

---

### **5. Emulate the NFC Tag**
- Navigate to the saved tag in the NFC menu.
- Choose **Emulate** and test by tapping the Flipper Zero on an NFC reader.

---

## **Practical Applications**
- **Backup Tags**: Save duplicates of important tags.
- **Test Security**: Evaluate vulnerabilities in NFC systems.
- **Learn NFC Technology**: Explore how NFC works to safeguard it.

---

## **Tips and Warnings**
- **Compatibility**: Encrypted/proprietary tags may not be clonable.
- **Ethical Use**: Always have explicit permission before cloning.
- **Organization**: Keep tag names clear for quick access.
