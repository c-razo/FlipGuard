NFC Tag Reading and Cloning Draft Content
Introduction

What is NFC?
Near-Field Communication (NFC) is a wireless communication protocol that allows devices to exchange data over short distances. NFC is widely used in:

Access control systems (e.g., office badges, hotel room keys).
Contactless payment cards.
Smart home devices.
Why is it Useful?
With Flipper Zero, you can:

Read and store NFC tags for backup or analysis.
Clone tags onto writable NFC cards.
Emulate an NFC tag for testing purposes.
Ethical Note: Always ensure you have permission to read or clone NFC tags.

Step-by-Step Guide

Step 1: Power Up Your Flipper Zero

Turn on your Flipper Zero and navigate to the NFC application.
Select Read NFC.
Step 2: Scan the NFC Tag

Hold the NFC tag (e.g., badge or key) close to the back of the Flipper Zero.
Wait for the device to recognize and display the tag’s data, such as:
Tag ID
Type (e.g., MIFARE Classic)
Size
Example Output:

Tag ID: 04:A3:22:1B:58:8F:4C
Type: MIFARE Classic
Size: 1 KB
Step 3: Save the Tag Data

Once the tag is read, save its data by selecting Save.
Name the saved tag for easy reference later.
Step 4: Clone the NFC Tag

Insert a writable NFC tag into the Flipper Zero’s writable field (or use a compatible blank card).
Select Write and choose the saved tag from the list.
The Flipper Zero will write the tag data onto the blank NFC tag.
Step 5: Emulate the NFC Tag

Navigate to the saved tag in the NFC menu.
Select Emulate to temporarily act as the NFC tag.
Test it by tapping the Flipper Zero on a compatible NFC reader.
Practical Applications

Backup Tags: Create a backup copy of your access badges for convenience.
Testing Security: Assess the vulnerability of an NFC-based system by testing cloned or emulated tags.
Educational Use: Learn how NFC systems work and how to protect against cloning attacks.
Tips and Warnings

Compatibility: Some tags, like encrypted or proprietary ones, may not be fully clonable.
Ethical Use: Only read or clone NFC tags you own or have explicit permission to test.
Tag Types: Research tag types (e.g., MIFARE, NTAG) to understand their features and limitations.
