### **Hack 9: Keylogger Development Tool**

## **Introduction**
A keylogger is a tool designed to capture keyboard input for analysis. The Flipper Zero can be used as a keylogging development tool to:
- **Test keyboard vulnerabilities**.
- **Learn how keyloggers operate**.
- **Develop detection methods** to secure devices.

> **Note**: Use this feature only on devices you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **1. Set Up the Flipper Zero for USB Debugging**
- Connect the Flipper Zero to a computer using a USB cable.
- Navigate to **Applications > USB Tools**.
- Select **HID Emulation** to prepare for keyboard interactions.

---

### **2. Enable Keylogger Mode**
- From the HID Emulation menu, select **Keylogger**.
- The Flipper Zero will begin capturing input from the connected device.
- Test by typing on the target keyboard and observing the Flipper Zero’s display.

---

### **3. Save Captured Keystrokes**
- Once the keylogger captures input, save the data:
  - Navigate to the **Logs** section.
  - Select **Save Log** and enter a descriptive name (e.g., “Test Log 1”).
- The log will be stored on the Flipper Zero for later analysis.

---

### **4. Analyze Keylogging Data**
- Open the saved log file on the Flipper Zero or export it to a computer for further analysis.
- Identify patterns in the captured input to understand the effectiveness of the keylogger.

---

### **5. Develop Keylogger Detection Techniques**
- Use the captured data to explore ways to detect and mitigate keylogging:
  - Monitor unusual USB activity.
  - Analyze unexpected HID inputs.
  - Test keyboard encryption methods.

---

## **Practical Applications**
- **Security Testing**: Identify vulnerabilities in USB-connected keyboards.
- **Educational Use**: Learn how keyloggers operate to better defend against them.
- **Develop Countermeasures**: Create tools to detect and block malicious keylogging.

---

## **Tips and Warnings**
- **Ethical Use Only**: Only test devices you own or have explicit permission to analyze.
- **Avoid Sensitive Data**: Do not capture or store real passwords or personal information.
- **Secure Logs**: Store keylogging data in a secure location to prevent misuse.
